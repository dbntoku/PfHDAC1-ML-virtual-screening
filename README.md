# PfHDAC1-ML-virtual-screening
The repository includes all datasets, Python scripts, trained machine learning models (serialized via pickle), and molecular structure files. It enables full reproducibility of the ML model training, virtual screening workflows, and docking analyses. Dependencies include Python 3.10.0, Pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, RDKit, and Mordred.
